Problem Statement: 4.9

You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard
deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?

Solution:
    
    Here X value = 1100 
    
    Z-score = 1100 - mean/Standard deviation
    
    Z = 1100-1026/209 = 0.354
    
   Find the z-value in the z-table :
     A z-score of 0.354 = 0.1368 + .5000* = .6368 or 63.68%.
     
     [Note: The z-table shown has scores for the right of the mean. Therefore, we have to add .5000]
